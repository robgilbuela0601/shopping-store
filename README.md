## Goals

●	Create an online shopping store using React & Typescript. The codebase should be maintainable and optimized. See mockup design for reference. You can also implement your own design.
●	Show list of available items with image, product name, category, price, description, and “Add to cart” button. The items data can be found in items.json file. 
●	Items can be filtered by productName, category, and can be sorted by unitPrice.
●	Upon clicking “Add to cart”, the item will be listed in the “My Cart” section. The latest added item will be on the top list.
●	Save the “My Cart” items to localStorage to persist the data even if the user refreshes the page.
●	The quantity of the “My Cart” items can be adjusted and can also be removed
●	The price of each “My Cart” item is equal to the unitPrice multiplied by quantity.
●	Upon clicking the “Clear Cart” button, all the items will be removed from the cart.
●	Display the total items and total amount of items at the bottom of the “My Cart” section. The total items is equal to the sum of each quantity of the items. The total amount is the sum of all the item's unitPrice multiplied by the item’s quantity.
●	Upon clicking the “Checkout button”, display a modal that says “Thank you for purchasing”, then clear the “My Cart” items.
●	Push your code on a public Github repository and share the link to us. Make sure to add instructions on how to run your app.
